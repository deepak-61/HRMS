# HRMS Platform - UPTIQ Internship Project

A comprehensive Human Resource Management System built with microservices architecture for the UPTIQ Fresher Onboarding Program Week 3 project.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This HRMS platform demonstrates production-ready engineering practices with:

- Git

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hrms-platform
   ```

2. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Wait for services to be ready** (about 2-3 minutes)
   - Employee Service: http://localhost:3001
   - HR Operations Service: http://localhost:3002
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Role-based dashboards)
   - API Documentation: 
     - Employee Service: http://localhost:3001/api-docs
     - HR Operations Service: http://localhost:3002/api-docs

### Local Development Setup

1. **Start databases**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up postgres mongodb -d
   ```

2. **Setup Employee Service**
   ```bash
   cd services/employee-service
   npm install
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma db seed
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Setup HR Operations Service**
   ```bash
   cd services/hr-operations-service
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Setup Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## üìä Demo Accounts - Role-Based Dashboards

Each login redirects to a different dashboard based on user role:

| Role | Email | Password | Dashboard Features |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| üëë **Administrator** | admin@company.com | password123 | **Full System Control**<br/>‚Ä¢ All employee management<br/>‚Ä¢ System settings & analytics<br/>‚Ä¢ User management<br/>‚Ä¢ Audit logs & advanced reports |
| üë• **HR Manager** | jane.smith@company.com | password123 | **HR Operations**<br/>‚Ä¢ Employee management<br/>‚Ä¢ Leave request approvals<br/>‚Ä¢ Attendance reports<br/>‚Ä¢ Recruitment & performance |
| üë§ **Employee** | john.doe@company.com | password123 | **Self-Service Portal**<br/>‚Ä¢ Personal dashboard<br/>‚Ä¢ Leave requests<br/>‚Ä¢ Attendance tracking<br/>‚Ä¢ Profile management |
| üë§ **Employee** | mike.johnson@company.com | password123 | Finance department employee |
| üë§ **Employee** | sarah.wilson@company.com | password123 | Marketing department employee |

> **Note**: The system automatically detects user role and redirects to the appropriate dashboard with role-specific navigation and features.
